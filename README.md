I am one of the outreach person of Tamil wikisource. Many new newbies are asking books on the basis of numbers. So, i am creating this code to classify and write categories according to the existing book index of Tamil wikisource. Just write index  names in 'அட்டவணைகள்.txt' and run this programme. Kindly feel free to mail me.
